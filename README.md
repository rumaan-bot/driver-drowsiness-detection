# Driver-drowsiness-detection
This is a project implementing Computer Vision and Deep Learning concepts to detect drowsiness of a driver .
Facial landmarks on the detected face are pointed and subsequently the eye aspect ratio, mouth opening ratio and nose length ratio are computed and depending on their values, drowsiness is detected based on developed adaptive thresholding.
